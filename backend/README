Installing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
1. Using VSCode as our IDE, its installation can be found here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.
2. Launch VSCode, visit the "Extensions" tab, and download the Python extension.

FastAPI "Hello World"
1. Create a folder on your desktop; for example, "VSCode Test"
2. in VSCode, open "VSCode Test" by going to File > Open Folder > VSCode Test
3. In VSCode, create a new text file by going to File > New Text File, then paste in the following (without quotations):
  "fastapi
  redis
  types-redis
  uvicorn"
4. Save the following text file as "requirements.txt"
5. Create a Virtual Environment by pressing CTRL + Shift + P, then Python: Create Environment > Venv > Requirements.txt.
6. Create a new (Python) file and save it as "main.py". Then paste the following:
"from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}"
8. You may receive a pop-up on which configuration file to use, click on "FastAPI".
9. Run the file by typing "uvicorn main:app --reload" in the terminal.
10.  The terminal will output an http link, which should produce the "Hello World" page.

Returning SQLite Verion
1. Update the main.py file from above to include "import sqlite3", then replace the body after
"@app.get("/")" with 
    "conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version()")
    result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    conn.close()
    return {"message": result}".
2. This body will do several tasks:
    Connect to the SQLite database and execute the query, then fetch and return the result.
