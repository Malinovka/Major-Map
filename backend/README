Installing an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
1. Using VSCode as our IDE, its installation can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Afterwards, download the Python extension in VSCode.

Reference Manual [Here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/#install-fastapi]).
If the above steps did not work, what worked for me was:
1. Go to your start menu and type in "Manage App Execution Aliases" and turn off Python.
2. a) For Windows:
        Open Command Prompt from your start menu, and type "py -m pip install fastapi", then press enter.
2. b) For Mac:
        Open Terminal and type "pip install fastapi uvicorn"
3. For Windows:
        Then in the Command Prompt, type "py -m pip install uvicorn", then press enter.

Installing an Integrated Development Environment/IDE.
1. I used VSCode as my Python IDE.
2. Installation for VSCode can be found [Here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 
3. Launch VSCode, and download the Python Extension from your browser (or through VSCode in the second category from the bottom, where you type in "Python") if you have not yet. You can find the link (here)[https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python]

3. Create a Virtual Python Environment, then click on Venv and Requirements.txt.
4. Follow the steps [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/) to return "Hello World"

Returning SQLite Verion
1. Update the main.py file from above to include "import sqlite3", then replace the body after with
```
"@app.get("/")" with: 
    "conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT sqlite_version()")
    result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
    conn.close()
    return {"message": result}".
```
Creating Tables
1. Create a new file within the folder you wish to create the tables for, then run query.
2. Follow the steps [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-create-table/)

Created POST Endpoints
1. Follow the documentation [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/#step-3-create-a-path-operation)
2. Install the POSTMAN extension on VSCode, or visit the /doc link after running the server, and test each POST functions. If using POSTMAN, ensure that you set the text type to JSON.
